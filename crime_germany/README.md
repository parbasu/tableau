**Data source:**

The source of all the data in the visualizations is the PDF file titled PCS 2019 - Police Crime Statistics Report, which is avalaible at the Bundeskriminalamt [website](http://www.bka.de/EN). I have also uploaded it [here](https://github.com/parbasu/tableau/blob/main/crime_germany/pks2019_englisch.pdf).

I extracted the data from the PDF using [Tabula](https://tabula.technology/). The tables didn't come out nice, so I had to do a lot of cleaning up in Google Sheets. The end result of that process can be found [here](https://github.com/parbasu/tableau/blob/main/crime_germany/pcs2019_clean_raw_data.xlsx). The title of each worksheet tells you the pages from which the data was extracted.

Note: The data is also avalaible as an Excel spreadsheet but it is too detailed. Unless you know how to group together different offence types under one category and which criminal offences to emphasize, you are only going to get confused and end up making a lot of mistakes! The report on the other hand contains the aggregated data corresponding to the different offence categories.

**Data preparation:**

The clean raw data is still unusable for Tableau.
