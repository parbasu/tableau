# European Social Survey Data

<https://www.europeansocialsurvey.org/>

The European Social Survey (ESS) collects survey data on social attitudes across over
30 European nations.

It is basically used to track how attitudes have changed over time and how they vary between countries in Europe. It runs every two years and the first survey was conducted in 2002. As of now, 9 rounds have been completed, the most recent one took place in 2018.

All the data is freely available for non-commercial use. You just have to do a quick email registration. I'll get into that in a bit.
